1. Introduction to Linux and initial setup
 
2. Knowing the Linux terminal and its shortcuts
 
3. Commands for manipulating files and texts and redirection
 
4. Linux Directories and System Commands
 
5. Network Fundamentals and Network Commands
6. Getting around in Linux with various commands history: show command history
history -c: clear command history
 
alias hh='history': Name (create variable) the command
nl file.txt: Show the file as well as cat and show the number of lines wc -l file.txt: Returns the number of lines in a file.
wc -w file.txt: Returns the number of words in a file.
wc -m file.txt: Returns the number of characters in a file.
 
ls -a: Returns hidden files
cmp file1.txt file2.txt: Compare files
 
diff file.txt: Returns the difference in the file sort -n fileNumeric.txt: Returns the numbers sorted last reboot: Returns all system boot information route -n: Show all Kernel IP routing tables
time command: Returns the process time of the command to be executed

uptime: Shows the time the system is up
 
cowsay "phrase": Returns the phrase with a "kitty"
xcowsay: Returns the phrase with a "kitty" jumping off the screen cmatrix: Matrix film effect
 
init 0: Shut down the machine now telinit0: Shut down the machine now
halt: Ask for authentication to shut down the machine
seq initialNumber endNumber: Prints a sequence of numbers

7. Control of users, groups and permissions sudo adduser <username>: Add a new user
su <username>: Change user
passwd <username>: Change the user's password
lastlog: View user login information
last: Displays a list of user input and output in the system logname: Name of the current user logged into the system
id: Displays all user IDs
cat /etc/passwd - Displays all users
userdel -r <username>: Remove a user and the user's home folder
 
groups
Lets you organize users and set file and directory access permissions more easily. cat /etc/group: Displays all existing groups on the system
groups: Displays all user groups addgroup <groupname>: Create a group
adduser <username> <groupname>: Add user to a group
gpasswd -a <username> <groupname>: Add another user to a group
gpasswd -d <username> <groupname>: Remove another user to a group 
<groupname>: Remove a group
 
permissions
They serve to restrict accesses such as: reading, writing and execution, where:

r - read(read)
a - write(writing)
b - eXecution(execution)
 

User(owner)	Group	Other	
r w x	    r w x	r w	x
4 2 1	    4 2 1	4 2	1

ls -lh: Check permissions on a directory, file size, creation date, user owner, groups it belongs to. 

OCTAL TABLE
drwxr-xr-x: d(directory) rwx (owner) rx(user in group) rx(other users in group)
*rx(read permission, no write permission, execute permission copy, paste, etc.)
-rw-rw-r--: -(file) rw- (owner) rw-(user in group) r--(other users in group)
*rw-(read permission, write permission, no execute permission) chmod: Change permission of a file or directory
Octal Mode (Mask composed of numbers under base 8, i.e. from 0 to 7) First digit represents the owner of the file/group (u)
The second digit represents the group (g) The third digit represents the others (o)
*Permissions are specific to each group
 
chmod command
chmod 000 - Change file/group permission to nothing
chmod 100 - Change file/group permission to modification only chmod 200 - Change file/group permission to write-only
chmod 300 - Change file/group permission for writing and modification chmod 400 - Change file/group permission for reading
chmod 500 - Change file/group permission for reading and modification chmod 600 - Change file/group permission for read and write
chmod 700 - Change file/group permission for reading, writing and modification
* The same goes for the other two houses.
 
*sudo su: Enter root mode
 
8. Compression, decompression and archiving
Compressors are programs that decrease the size of a file or directory.

Extensions identify the type of a file and the program needed to run it.
 
gzip <filename>.txt: Very used compressor with excellent compression. gunzip file.txt.gz: Unzip gzip files
gzip -9 file.txt: Use maximum compression.
 
zip: <compressionname>.zip file.txt: Compress the file to .zip unzip <ipfilename>.zip: Unzip the .zip file
 
bzip2: Compressor more current than gzip and zip bzip2 <filename>.txt
unbzip2 -d <bzipfilename2>.bzip2: Unzip the .bzip2 file
rar - Compactor that needs to be installed on its first use rar a <filenamerar>.rar <filename>.txt
*the action
rar x <filename>.rar: Unzip rar file
 
filers
Merge multiple files into a single file. tar: tar is a widely used archiver on Linux
tar -cf <filename>.tar <files>.txt: Compress the file in tar tar -xvf <targzfilename>.tar.gz: Unzip .tar and tar.gz file
 
 
9. Package Management
Packages: Programs placed inside a file identified by its extension, and include files needed to install the program. Ex: .deb, .rpm and others.
 
Package managers are systems that have automatic dependency resolution between packages, easy method of package installation. Ex: dpkg, apt and yum.
 
Installing packages/programs with apt sudo apt install <packagename>
 
Updating packages/programs with apt

sudo apt upgrade <packagename>
 
Removing packages/programs with apt sudo apt remove <packagename>
Updating systems, packages, programs, libraries, files, etc with apt. apt update
apt upgrade
apt update && apt upgrade
*sudo su: Enter root mode
 
package websites pkgs.org rpm.pbone.net
 
*Note: None of these commands can be stopped as they can corrupt the process.
Installing .deb packages/programs with dpkg sudo dpkg -i <packagename>
 
Package Description
sudo dpkg -I <packagename>.deb
 
Removing .deb packages/programs with dpkg sudo dpkg -r <packagename>
*Use the description command to get the package name on the Package line: Managed RPM - Fedora
Installing .rpm packages/programs rpm -vh <packagename>.rpm
*Dependency failure
sudo rpm -ivh --nodeps <packagename>.rpm
 
Updating .rpm packages/programs rpm -U <packagename>.rpm
 
Removing .rpm packages/programs rpm -e <packagename>.rpm

Installing YUM packages/programs sudo yum install <packagename>
 
Updating YUM packages/programs sudo yum update <packagename>
 
Removing YUM packages/programs sudo yum remove <packagename>
